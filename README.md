# PSWC-SEM2
## GradeCard

### Overview
Briefly describe what the GradeCard does and its purpose.

### Files
- **mk.h:** Header file containing declarations
- **marks.c:** Code file for student-related functions
- **main.c:** Main program file
- **mkfile.mk:** Makefile containing compilation instructions

### Compilation
To compile the project using MingW64 on Windows Command Prompt:
```bash
mingw32-make -f mkfile.mk
```

### Execution
After compilation, the output file will be named **PES_Official_GradeCaed**. Run it to use the GradeCard.

### Usage
Explain how to use the GradeCardProgram, input formats, expected outputs, etc.

### Dependencies

- **MingW64:** Compiler used for compiling the code
- **Standard C Libraries:**
  - **stdio.h**: For input and output operations.
  - **stdlib.h**: For memory allocation, random number generation, and other general utilities.
  - **string.h**: For string manipulation functions.
  - **math.h**: For mathematical functions like trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
  - **ctype.h**: For character handling functions.
  - **time.h**: For date and time functions.
- **Makefile Libraries:**
